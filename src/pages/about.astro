      I've worked with a wide range of technologies over the years:
      <ul>
        <li>
          On the server side, I've built products using Ruby, PHP, and Node.js, and also explored Golang for developing scalable microservices and distributed systems.

        <li>
          On the client side, my journey started with the early days of the web ‚Äî from VanillaJS and jQuery, through AngularJS and Angular 2, and finally to React, which has become my main focus for building modern, high-performance interfaces.
        </li>
      </ul>

        From a technical standpoint, my main interests revolve around web performance optimization,
