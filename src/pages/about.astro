          I've been developing web applications as a Full Stack Developer since 2006,
          taking on <span class="bg-accent-two px-1 !text-white">various roles throughout my career</span> — from Software Developer
          and Lead Developer to Head of Research and Development, and finally CTO.
        </p>
        <p>
          Across every project, my main goal has always been to build meaningful and reliable tools that have a real impact on people’s lives.

      I've worked with a wide range of technologies over the years:
      <ul>
        <li>
          On the server side, my journey began with Ruby and PHP before expanding into Go. Most recently, I've been working with Node.js and Java/Spring Boot to build high-performance microservices and distributed systems.        </li>
        <li>
          On the client side, I've started with the early days of the web — from VanillaJS and jQuery, through AngularJS and Angular 2, and finally to React, which has become my main focus for building modern, high-performance interfaces.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From a technical standpoint, my main interests revolve around web performance optimization,

        , and the promotion of open-source technologies that foster collaboration and long-term maintainability.

  Whenever I’m not thinking about software development:
  <ul>
    <li>
      I’m usually contributing to
      <a
        href="https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/frandieguez"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
      >
        open-source projects
      </a>
      👨‍💻 like <strong>GNOME</strong> (as a long-time member of the GNOME
      Foundation) or coordinating the Galician translation team for Ubuntu.
      I also enjoy

        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
      >
        reading
      </a>
      — mostly about technology, design, and personal growth — and exploring new
      ideas to make tech more accessible and sustainable.
    </li>

    <li>
      When I’m away from the keyboard, you’ll probably find me training at the
      gym 💪, practicing CrossFit, going hiking through the forests of Galicia 🌲,
      or hitting the slopes on my snowboard 🏂.
    </li>

    <li>
      I’m also passionate about home automation and smart living — most of my
      house is connected through Home Assistant and Zigbee2MQTT, with custom
      automations that make daily life smoother (and geekier 😄).
    </li>
  </ul>

  Currently, I’m <strong>not available for hire</strong>, but feel free to reach
  out if you’d like to collaborate on innovative or meaningful future projects.
