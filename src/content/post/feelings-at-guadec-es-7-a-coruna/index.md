Last  Thursday and Friday I was in Coruña attending to the GUADEC-ES,
the most important event of GNOME and "hispanic version" of GNOME Users
and Developers Conference. It was my first event focused in GNOME and
was simply amazing. I met a lot of GNOME Hackers and get the feeling
that I'm in a collaborate with great community. I enjoy all the talks
but I have to highlight some of them.

- **Git it done\!** <span style="font-weight: normal;">by [Mario
  Sánchez](http://blogs.igalia.com/mario/). I use git for more than 2
  years but Mario gave us a glorifious crash course about it. You can
  find the slides \[ES\] in the next link:

- Other of the talks that I prefer is "**GNOME 3 para
  desarrolladores**" (GNOME 3 for developers). Carlos Garcia Campos
  explain us the main differences between last GNOME libraries and
  what was done to achieve GNOME 3. Clean up \!\!
- The great discovery talk was "**Vala, un lenguaje para Gnome 3.0**"
  by [Roberto Majadas](http://www.openshine.com/). I heared just a
  little about Vala but Roberto with a lot of examples explain us the
  posibilities that Vala has to develop with a high-level language but
  with the benefits of optimization and speed of C language.
- And finally  "**cómo estudiar y participar en software libre sin
  morir en el intento**" (How to study and participate in Free
  Software without die trying). [Diego
  Escalante](http://people.gnome.org/~diegoe/), developer of Epiphany,
  IMHO is the best speaker I have the pleasure to attend. The talk had
  a funny tone mixed with real experiences. Again you can find the
  slides here:

GPUL, coorganizers of this GUADEC, promised to make accesible all the
videos recorded there. When this happen I'll update this post to link
them. Conclusion: I recommend all to go this type of conferences cause
you can learn a lot in just some hours and you'll meet a lot of amazing
people.
