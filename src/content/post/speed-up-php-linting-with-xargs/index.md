Most of us use Jenkins to continuously integrate our projects with every commit to the repository, but when it comes with PHP most of the time is spent "<a title="Linting software" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">linting</a>".

This action is badly slow and if your project has a lot of files this will take a good percentage of your build time. A really good approach could be executing this task with different files in parallel. For this you can use the powerful <em>xargs</em> command with -P0, which allows xargs to run as many processes as possible at a time.

```bash
find codefolder/ -name "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P0 php -l
```

So the final snippet for your Ant based project will be:

```xml
<target name="lint">
  <exec executable="sh" failonerror="true">
      <arg value="-c" />
      <arg value="find ${project.paths.php.space-separated} -name *.php -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P0 php -l"/>
  </exec>
</target>
```
