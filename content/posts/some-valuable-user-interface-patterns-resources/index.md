Last week I've been investigating about Web UI Patterns and
anything concerning Social Media Patterns, mainly focused on building
a consistent UI Pattern Toolkit that I'll release as soon it will be
ready. In this searching I found some valuable resources with incredible
useful UI Patterns solutions, with some discussions around them:

- The first resource is about patterns that applies to social media
  sites, there you can find a lot of ideas for implementing common
  interface problems in a homogeneous way. This decrease the "User
  first expectation" a lot by trying to apply the same solution across
  every site: Here's the link:
  [http://www.socialdesignpatterns.com/](http://www.socialdesignpatterns.com/ "Social Design Patterns")

- The second, and last, resource is focused directly on UI Patterns
  for the web. Here
  [http://ui-patterns.com/](http://ui-patterns.com/ "UI Patterns") I
  found a lot of approaches that other sites have applied to it's
  problems: drop-down menus, Calendar pickers, Activity streams,
  In-place editors, etc. all of them with screenshots and reviews.

Additionally, you can find a lot of books regarding this subject:

Certainly, some valuable UI Patterns solutions all of us must take in
place. I hope you enjoy all of them and if you have any suggestion or
