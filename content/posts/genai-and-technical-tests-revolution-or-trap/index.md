With the popularity of models like ChatGPT and Codex, more and more developers are turning to AI to solve coding problems, optimize solutions, and even practice technical interviews. But this raises a key question: is OpenAI changing the way developers are evaluated?

## ‚úÖ The Positive Side

AI has brought clear advantages to technical assessments:

- **Better preparation**: Allows developers to practice algorithm problems and receive detailed explanations.
- **Accelerated learning**: Suggests improvements in code, teaches best practices, and helps understand complex concepts.
- **Debugging assistance**: Instead of getting stuck on trivial errors, developers can quickly ask for help and keep moving forward.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks and Challenges

However, companies are also starting to notice some issues:

- **Excessive dependency**: Some candidates rely so much on AI that they struggle to solve problems without it.
- **Biased evaluation**: If a candidate uses OpenAI to complete a take-home test, does it truly reflect their skills?
- **False expectations**: AI-generated code may look correct, but without understanding it, a developer might not know how to modify or explain it.

## How to Adapt to This New Reality?

Both developers and companies need to find a balance:

**For candidates**: Use AI to learn, but make sure to fully understand and explain every solution.

**For companies**: Design technical tests where the focus is not just on the final answer but on the thought process behind it.

## üîÆ The Future of Technical Assessments

Traditional assessments may evolve, putting more emphasis on logical thinking, system design, and live debugging rather than simply solving coding problems.

OpenAI does not replace programming skills, but it does change the way we learn and demonstrate our abilities. Knowing how to use it wisely can be the difference between a great candidate and one who just copies answers. üöÄ
