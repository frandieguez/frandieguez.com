<strong>Fran Diéguez</strong> has been developing web applications for 7 years now, the last two as a <strong>Project Manager and CTO at OpenHost</strong>, where he spends his days and nights on improving a powerful tool for online publishing, <a href="http://www.opennemas.com/">OpenNemas</a>.  For achieving this hard task he and his team are developing their own framework, Onm, focused in high performance and heavy loaded online newspapers.

For a long time his main focus was web performance <a href="https://github.com/frandieguez">engineering</a> and open source technology.

Prior to focusing on online newspapers, Fran worked as a open-source software developer at the University of Santiago de Compostela, where he have <strong>developed a custom Linux-based desktop</strong> for simplifying administrative tasks and also doing massive migrations to open source sofware in educational settings.
