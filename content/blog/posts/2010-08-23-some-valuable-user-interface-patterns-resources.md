Last week I've been investigating about Web UI Patterns and anything concerning Social Media Patterns, mainly focused on building a consistent UI Pattern Toolkit that I'll release as soon it will be ready.

In this searching I found some valuable resources with incredible useful UI Patterns solutions, with some discussions around them:
<ul>
	<li>The first resource is about patterns that applies to social media sites, there you can find a lot of ideas for implementing common interface problems in a homogeneous way. This decrease the "User first expectation" a lot by trying to apply the same solution across every site: Here's the link: <a title="Social Design Patterns" href="http://www.socialdesignpatterns.com/">http://www.socialdesignpatterns.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The second, and last, resource is focused directly on UI Patterns for the web. Here <a title="UI Patterns" href="http://ui-patterns.com/">http://ui-patterns.com/</a> I found a lot of approaches that other sites have applied to it's problems: drop-down menus, Calendar pickers, Activity streams, In-place editors, etc. all of them with screenshots and reviews.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, you can find a lot of books regarding this subject:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Interfaces-Patterns-Effective-Interaction/dp/0596008031/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1282580885&amp;sr=8-1"><img class="alignnone" style="max-width: 30%; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; border: 0px;" title="Amazon.com" alt="Amazon.com" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2141/2435522965_9e7771e137_m.jpg" width="240" height="156" border="0" hspace="5" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Project-Guide-Design-experience-designers/dp/0321607376/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b"><img class="alignnone" style="max-width: 30%; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; border: 0px;" title="UX Pile" alt="UX Pile" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3218/2805069373_0d0df00bca_m.jpg" width="185" height="240" border="0" hspace="5" /></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/User-Interface-Design-Programmers-Spolsky/dp/1893115941/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1282580946&amp;sr=1-1"><img class="alignnone" style="max-width: 30%; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; border: 0px;" title="updating my skills" alt="updating my skills" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/2795643169_b2cab661b6_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" border="0" hspace="5" /></a>

Certainly, some valuable UI Patterns solutions all of us must take in place. I hope you enjoy all of them and if you have any suggestion or tip please write a comment bellow.
