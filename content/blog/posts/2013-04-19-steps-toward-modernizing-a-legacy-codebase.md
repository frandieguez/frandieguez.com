Paul M Jones presented at the Nashville PHP User Group on August 13th, 2012 on modernizing legacy code.

"We've all been there, dropped into a codebase that makes perfect sense to the original developers but might as well be Greek to you. Paul will help you make sense of things with some helpful tips for untangling the spaghetti and how to move it towards a more modern, modular architecture while keeping it running the whole time."
