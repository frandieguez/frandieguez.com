Last  Thursday and Friday I was in Coruña attending to the GUADEC-ES, the most important event of GNOME and "hispanic version" of GNOME Users and Developers Conference.
It was my first event focused in GNOME and was simply amazing. I met a lot of GNOME Hackers and get the feeling that I'm in a collaborate with great community.

I enjoy all the talks but I have to highlight some of them.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Git it done!</strong> <span style="font-weight: normal;">by <a href="http://blogs.igalia.com/mario/">Mario Sánchez</a>. I use git for more than 2 years but Mario gave us a glorifious crash course about it. You can find the slides [ES] in the next link: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wzqy6d">http://tinyurl.com/2wzqy6d</a></span></li>
	<li>Other of the talks that I prefer is "<strong>GNOME 3 para desarrolladores</strong>" (GNOME 3 for developers). Carlos Garcia Campos explain us the main differences between last GNOME libraries and what was done to achieve GNOME 3. Clean up !!</li>
	<li>The great discovery talk was "<strong>Vala, un lenguaje para Gnome 3.0</strong>" by <a href="http://www.openshine.com/">Roberto Majadas</a>. I heared just a little about Vala but Roberto with a lot of examples explain us the posibilities that Vala has to develop with a high-level language but with the benefits of optimization and speed of C language.</li>
	<li>And finally  "<strong>cómo estudiar y participar en software libre sin morir en el intento</strong>" (How to study and participate in Free Software without die trying). <a href="http://people.gnome.org/~diegoe/">Diego Escalante</a>, developer of Epiphany, IMHO is the best speaker I have the pleasure to attend. The talk had a funny tone mixed with real experiences. Again you can find the slides here: <a href="http://people.gnome.org/~diegoe/slides/20100723_Coru%25C3%25B1a_Estudiar-y-participar.pdf ">http://people.gnome.org/~diegoe/slides/20100723_Coru%25C3%25B1a_Estudiar-y-participar.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
GPUL, coorganizers of this GUADEC, promised to make accesible all the videos recorded there. When this happen I'll update this post to link them.

Conclusion: I recommend all to go this type of conferences cause you can learn a lot in just some hours and you'll meet a lot of amazing people.
